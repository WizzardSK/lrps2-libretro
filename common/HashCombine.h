// Use XXH3 for combining, matching the hash already used for the GS shader
// caches (see GSXXH.h). The previous implementation was the boost hash_combine
// mixer over std::hash<T>; for the integral keys every call site passes,
// std::hash<integer> is the identity function, so structured/sequential keys
// (pipeline and PSSelector bitfields, etc.) went into a weak mixer with poor
// avalanche. XXH3 gives proper avalanche and is the fastest hash already
// vendored, so this is both more uniform and better distributed.
